# Email Trigger for AWS

This repository contains supporting material for a blog post on Medium. There are three files:

- `setup.sh` serves as a reference for the three basic terraform comamnds.
- `lambda.py` provides a basic lambda function as a starting point for experimentation.
- `eMailTrigger.tf` is the terraform file with all resources and configurations necessary to spin up the trigger.
